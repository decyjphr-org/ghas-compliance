# ghas-compliance 

A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) for enforcing GHAS compliance policies.  
App will block merges for high severity alerts for critical apps and allow merges of PRs for non-critical, no-internet access (NCNIA) apps.  

## Workflows
The various workflows this app will address are illustrated below:

### On-Demand Post-Migration Workflow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A(Migration complete) -->|Enable GHAS | B[[`GHAS Compliance` create an initial check]]
    B --> C[[`GHAS Compliance` create branch protections with the required checks]]
    C --> D[[`GHAS Compliance` enable Codescanning and secret scanning]]
    D --> E((End))
```
### PR based GHAS Compliance Workflow
```mermaid
graph TD
    PR1[User wants to merge] --> |Opens|PR2(Pull Request)
    PR2 -->|Webhook| PR3[CI code scan]
    PR3 -->|upload results with ref and sha| PR4((done))
    PR11[More commits] -->|Webhook| PR3
    PR2 -->|Webhook| PR5[[`GHAS Compliance` check for compliance]]
    PR11 -->|Webhook| PR5
    PR5 -->|Pass| PR8[Allow merge]
    PR8 --> PR11
    PR5 -->|Fail| PR6(Block)
    PR6 --> PR11
    PR8 --> PR7((end))
    PR6 --> PR7
```
### Alert Dismissal Workflow
```mermaid
graph TD
    DPR1[User dismisses alert] -->|Webhook| DPR2{Non-critical app}
    DPR2 -->|Yes| DPR8[Allow Dismiss]
    DPR2 -->|No| DPR4[[`GHAS Compliance` check run]]
    DPR4 -->|Pass| DPR8
    DPR4 -->|Fail| DPR5(Reopen the alert)
    DPR8 --> DPR6((end))
    DPR5 --> DPR6
```

### On-Demand GHAS Compliance Workflow
```mermaid
graph TD
    PR1[Post Jenkins Build] --> |Function|PR2(Trigger Repo Dispatch for Compliance Check)
    PR2 -->|Webhook with Ref, SHA| PR5[[`GHAS Compliance` check run]]
    PR5 -->|Pass| PR6[Show fa:fa-check and don't block]
    PR5 -->|Fail| PR7[Show fa:fa-x but don't block]
    PR6 --> PR8((end))
    PR7 --> PR8((end))
```

## Runtime Config
The app will look for runtime settings file that is referenced by the `RUNTIME_SETTINGS_FILE` value in the environment (or .env file).  

`NOTE`: It's best to provide the full path instead of the relative path for the `runtime` settings file. If you are providing a relative path, start with `../` to get to the root directory of the app and then provide the relative path. E.g. `../myconfig.yml` where myconfig.yml is at the root dir.

Here is a sample `runtime` config:

```yaml
branches:
  protection:
  patterns: ["main", "something"]
bypasschecks:
  always: false
  topics: ['ncnia']
repodispatch:
  createInitialCheck: true
  createBranchProtection: true
  enableAdvSec: true
policy:
  snooze: 20
policyPath:
  owner: 'decyjphr-org'
  repo: 'security-queries'
  path: 'policies/custom.yml'
  ref: 'main' 
emptyPolicy:
  codescanning:
    level: 
    conditions:
      ids: []
      names: []
      cwes: []
    ignores:
      ids: []
      names: []
      cwes: []
  secretscanning:
    conditions:
      types: []
    ignores:
      types: []
```

### Values in Runtime config
value | Desc
-- | --
bypasschecks.always | [true/false] Bypass check runs for all repos
bypasschecks.topics | List of topics for targeting repos to bypass the checks
repodispatch.createInitialCheck | [true/false] Create an initial check
repodispatch.createBranchProtection | [true/false] Create initial branch protection and add `GHAS Compliance` as required check
repodispatch.enableAdvSec | [true/false] Enable Adv Sec for the repo
policy.snooze | [integer] interval of seconds to snooze between checking if other CI jobs have completed
policyPath.owner | Default for the `Org` where the policy files are stored. 
policyPath.repo | Default for the `Repo` where the policy files are stored. 
policyPath.path | Default for the `filepath` for the policy file. 
policyPath.ref | Default for the `ref` for the policy file. 
emptyPolicy | Provide an empty policy file if the above policy file does not exist

`NOTE`: 
If `RUNTIME_SETTINGS_FILE` is not provided in the env, it would default to `runtime.yml` file at the root of the application. 

`NOTE`:  
If no runtime settings is provided, it would default to a hard-coded setting as follows:
```yaml
branches:
  protection:
  patterns: []
bypasschecks:
  always: false
  topics: []
repodispatch:
  createInitialCheck: true
  createBranchProtection: true
  enableAdvSec: true
policy:
  snooze: 20
policyPath:
  owner: 
  repo:
  path:
  ref:
emptyPolicy:
  codescanning:
    level: 
    conditions:
      ids: []
      names: []
      cwes: []
    ignores:
      ids: []
      names: []
      cwes: []
  secretscanning:
    conditions:
      types: []
    ignores:
      types: []
```

`NOTE`: 

The default `policypath` settings in the `runtime` config can be overriden in the repos by having a  `.github/policypath.yml` file.

## Policy
The policy config will allow an user to define 2 types of rules for
- code scanning
- secret scanning

Here is a sample policy file:
```yaml
codescanning:
  level: critical
  conditions:
    ids:
      - "*/sql-injection"
      - "*/xss"
      - "*/stored-xss"
      - "*/command-line-injection"
      - "*/zipslip"
    cwes:
      - cwe-0221
  ignores:
    ids:
      - js/log-injection
    names:
      - "Missing rate limiting"
      
secretscanning:
  conditions:
    types: 
    - "*"
  ignores:
    types: 
    - "aws*"
```

### Blocks
Each policy has blocks for `conditions` and `ignores`. They could be based on `ids`,`names`,`cwes` for code scanning; and based on `types` for secret scanning.

### Levels
Code Scanning policy could also be based on levels. The levels are:
`['notes', 'warning', 'low', 'moderate', 'medium', 'error', 'high', 'critical']`

### Known Issues
1. For a policy author, there is no simple way to map `secret_type_display_name` to `secret_type`. When an alert is dismissed, we get the alert event object with the `secret_type` as an attribute, but not `secret_type_display_name`. However, in the UI we don't see the `secret_type`; only `secret_type_display_name`, So as a policy author writing policies, I need to do the translation of what I see in the UI to the secret_type.
2. For a policy author, there is no simple way to categorize all partner secrets from custom secrets. The workaround is to have all custom secrets follow a naming convention.
3. For a policy author, the `cwe` labels using in Github might require a leading `0`. For e.g. `cwe-21` should be written as `cwe-021`
